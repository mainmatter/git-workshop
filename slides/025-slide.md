## Pull/Merge Request based workflows

![PR/MR based workflow](/images/pr-workflow.png)

Note:

- everyone is familiar with this generally by now and even if some teams would
  have more branches etc. (which I'd generally advice to avoid though), it's
  always the same: branch – validate – merge
- and virtually everyone is using git for that
- btw: GitHub and Bitbucket say Pull Requests while GitLab says Merge Request
  but they really all work the same way
- yet, it's not always as easy as it looks in this diagram and many people and
  teams are struggling with this workflow
- which is why we're doing this workshop
