#### Reviews

are for ensuring quality and sharing know-how

Note:

- of course you need automated testing but
  - quality isn't correctness: bad code can still work correctly
  - wrong code with wrong or no tests doesn't make a good package
- after pairing, reviewing is the best way there is to share know-how
  - you don't want to end up with only the author of something knowing anything
    about how it works
- …to make reviews work and work well though, make sure a PR fulfils the
  requirements…
