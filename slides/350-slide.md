#### Interactive Rebasing

Interactive Rebasing allows modifying the commits that are cherry-picked during
the rebase.

Note:

- we would often not only want to rebase
  - but maybe we want to remove some debug commits
  - or reorder the commits we did
  - or merge some commits that we made while figuring out the right solution to
    something into one commit
- …for all that we can do interactive rebasing…
