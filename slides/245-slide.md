## Example

Merging a branch into another one with Fast-Forward merging.

Note:

- both on the command line and with Fork:
  - on the `examples-ff-merge` branch, show there's one additional commit
    compared to the examples branch
  - merge `examples-ff-merge` into `examples`, show that that applies cleanly
- so this is easy but when talking about merging we're typically thinking of a
  more complicated scenarioâ€¦
