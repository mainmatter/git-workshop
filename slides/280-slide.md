## Remotes

Remotes enable collaboration across networks.

Note:

- remotes are versions of a repository you have cloned locally that exist
  somewhere on the network
- typically you'll have one remote which is your GitHub or GitLab server
  - but you can have multiple, e.g. a mirror of you main remote or even multiple
    remotes on the same GitHub/GitLab (e.g. forks)
