## Issues

Issues aren't just a place to put notes or high level requirements

Note:

- just a side note: these ideas are taken from the simplabs playbook which you
  can see at simplabs.com/playbook. You may think that this is a strange tangent
  for a git workshop but I'm telling you now: if you split your work into
  smaller managable chunks you will **avoid** most of the problems that you
  might need expert git skills to save you from.

- Well-prepared issues are a key element of an effective development process.
  They provide guidance for the project team's work, allow external parties not
  directly involved with the project to get an understanding of what is
  happening directly, and can serve as a future reference to understand what was
  done in a project, and for which reasons.
