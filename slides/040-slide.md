## Issues

Issues aren't just a place to put notes or high level requirements

Note:

- Well-prepared issues are a key element of an effective development process.
  They provide guidance for the project team's work, allow external parties not
  directly involved with the project to get an understanding of what is
  happening directly, and can serve as a future reference to understand what was
  done in a project, and for which reasons.
