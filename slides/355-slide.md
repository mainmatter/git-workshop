## Example

Rebasing our branch on the target branch and cleaning up some commits along the
way.

Note:

- both on the command line and with Fork:
  - on the `examples-merge-rebase` branch, show the commit history
    - one commit should not be there at all
    - 2 commits should be combined
  - rebase `examples-merge-rebase` interactively on the `examples` branch
    - remove the debug commit
    - combine the 2 text changes
