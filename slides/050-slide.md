#### Good issues aim to:

- describe what is to be done and why
- include a course of action
- include all necessary materials and references
- be a discrete unit of work

Note:

- add all context you have, including visual materials, a bit of history and
  alternatives that have been ruled out and why, etc.
  - the issue is not only written for the person doing the work who maybe has
    all the details in their head somewhere
  - that person might forget all those details but others don't know them
    anyway, yet might be interested in what's happening or have relevant
    information to share
  - issues are also relevant as historic artifacts when someone (sometimes even
    the issue's author) is trying to understand why something was done in
    hindsight
- figuring out what individual changes need to be made to close the issue is
  invaluable for uncovering uncertainties, hidden complexity or blockers
  - the alternative is you'll run into those later when you have spent time and
    work already which in the worst case is now useless
  - this is not about listing every single code change but listing the
    fundamental steps and most importantly thinking those through
  - if you cannot come up with this list, it's a great indicator the issue is
    not ready to be worked on yet –> do a spike first!
- the issue should be the central place for all information necessary to
  complete it
  - while collecting materials, references, etc. you'll realize if anything is
    missing and the issue is not ready to be worked on yet!
- separate tasks go into separate issues
  - ideally an issue is only a few days of work
  - that does not mean, bigger tasks can not be broken down but each issue
    should "make sense" on its own
- preparing issues like this takes time and in my experience it's important to
  make clear that this is an essential part of everyone's job
  - this is also not the task of the PM – they will not have the necessary
    context around everything to be able to prepare an issue like this
  - yet, neither can an engineer do it on their own – this requires input from
    all involved stakeholders!
- …so let's say you have an issue like that, what comes next…
