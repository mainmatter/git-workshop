## Example

Merging a branch into another with a 3-way merge.

Note:

- both on the command line and with Fork:
  - on the `examples-3way-merge` branch, show there's one additional commit
    compared to the examples branch
    - but there was also an additional commit to the `examples` branch in the
      meantime
  - merge `examples-3way-merge` into `examples`, resolve the conflict and show
    the merge commit
- …now you go…
