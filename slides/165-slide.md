## Task

We want to read the contents `README.md` with `git cat-file` at the
snapshot/commit 83d8100283ab5123f78f1e193ff29e37f686e636.

- get our [workshop repository](https://github.com/simplabs/git-workshop)
- get the OID of the tree that commit references
- get the OID of the blob the tree points to at path `README.md`
- get the contents of the blog with `git cat-file`

Make use https://git-scm.com/docs and `git <command> --help`.

Note:

- pair with 2 people & talk to each other about what you're doing
- …how do files and changes end up in our repo?…
