<div>Chris Manson - @real_ate</div>

Notes:

- I've just put a bit of an introduction slide in here because I imagine quite a
  few people here might not know me
- I'm a massive open source nut, spend a lot of my time hanging out in the Ember
  Community
- most of what I know about git comes from trying to fix my own mistakes on
  public repos over the years
- Fun fact: my first experience with git was in 2007 when I was working with the
  KDE open source project while they were in the middle of a process to move
  from CVS to git
