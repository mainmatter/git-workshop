Note:

- C6 is the new merge commit we created in the merge process
  - it has 2 parents which are the latest commits from the merged branch and the
    target branch
  - and the target branch's HEAD now is that new merge commit
- during the generation of this merge commit is when conflicts will occur that
  you'll fix then
