- Issues
- PRs/MRs
- Git
  - How does it even work? ðŸ™€
  - Branching and Merging
  - Rewriting history

Note:

- we'll be focussing on Git but since issues and PRs/MRs are the foundation of
  organizing our work, we'll look into those topics as well
- Then we'll look into how Git even works â€“ don't worry, it's easier than you
  might think and we're not going into every little detail
- Branching and merging are at the core of how we work so we'll look into what's
  actually happening when we use those features
- Taming and rewriting history is essential to a successful PR/MR based workflow
