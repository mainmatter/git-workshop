#### Commits

Commits are snapshots of the repository in time that reference a revision of the
root tree of the repo as well as their parent commit(s).

Note:

- in the case of merge commits, they will have multiple parent commits â€“ more on
  that later
- commits also contain meta-data like author, committer, date, etc.
- as we saw, the reference to the root tree is enough to refer to the entire
  repo at a particular revision
