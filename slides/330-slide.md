#### Cherry Picking

Cherry Picking allows applying changes introduced by **any** existing commit
**anywhere**.

Note:

- you just take a commit from some branch or anywhere and apply it to whatever
  the revision is you local repo is on
- you might have done that already when you wanted to have a commit from another
  branch in your current branch or so
- …one thing to understand about cherry picking is…
