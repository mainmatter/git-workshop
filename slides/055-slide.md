#### Iterations/Sprints

provide plannability and focus

Note:

- we prefer saying "iteration" – "sprint" is unfortunate wording since running a
  marathon in a series of sprints will not make you complete the marathon faster
  than a steady pace
  - you will likely even be slower and certainly much more exhausted when
    reaching the finish line
- iterations provide plannability and focus
  - it's clear to everyone what you plan to work on and what you don't plan to
    work on (of course plans can change and you want to remain open to that)
  - reducing scope to just 1-2 weeks also makes it easier to understand each
    single issue and prepare it as explained previously
    - you will find out things while preparing and working on the issues in the
      iteration and those learnings will inform prioritization as well as
      scoping and preparation of the issues for the next iteration
- …so you have your iteration with well-prepared issues, you take an issue and
  start coding away…
